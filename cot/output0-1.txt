"**best_atk_spd**: The story states, \"each blow weakened it further,\" indicating that the Frostbound Elemental becomes less resilient after taking damage. This suggests that faster attacks are ideal to capitalize on its deteriorating state, justifying [\"Fast\"] as the best attack speed.\n\n**weak**: The passage explicitly notes that \"blunt strikes wounded it deeply,\" which directly indicates increased damage from Blunt attacks. This supports [\"Blunt\"] being listed in weak, as the element is clearly effective against the monster.\n\n**resist**: The text states that \"poison barely touched it, and ice or lightning did little harm,\" showing reduced effectiveness for Poison, Ice, and Lightning. These elements fail to significantly affect the monster, justifying [\"Ice\", \"Poison\", \"Lightning\"] in resist.\n\n**special_eff**: There is no mention of any element having a unique or additional effect beyond normal damage mechanics (e.g., breaking shields, stacking damage, or bypassing defenses). While Blunt is effective, it is not described as uniquely so beyond its status as a weakness. Therefore, [] is correct for special_eff.\n\n**slow_eff**: The story mentions that \"slowing it amplified its suffering,\" implying that slowing effects significantly reduce its threat level or enhance vulnerability. This aligns with [\"Weak\"], meaning the monster is particularly disadvantaged when slowed.\n\n**occurrence**: The passage clearly states, \"only one could appear at a time,\" which matches the definition of [\"Single\"]—the monster always appears alone in a wave, never accompanied by others of its kind."
"**best_atk_spd**: The story states, \"each blow weakened it further,\" indicating that the Frostbound Elemental becomes progressively weaker as it takes damage. This means faster attacks will maximize damage output by triggering cumulative weakening effects sooner, justifying the [\"Fast\"] attack speed.\n\n**weak**: The passage explicitly notes that \"blunt strikes wounded it deeply,\" and a hunter’s account confirms \"best grab a club. Blunt force does the trick,\" showing blunt attacks are particularly effective. This direct language identifies [\"Blunt\"] as a clear weakness.\n\n**resist**: The text states that \"poison barely touched it, and ice or lightning did little harm,\" which directly indicates ineffectiveness of these elements. \"Barely touched\" and \"did little harm\" qualify as reduced damage, supporting [\"Ice\", \"Poison\", \"Lightning\"] in the resist list.\n\n**special_eff**: There is no mention of any element causing unique bonus effects beyond normal damage mechanics (e.g., breaking shields, stacking damage, or being the only way to harm). Although blunt is effective, it is not described as uniquely so in a way that exceeds standard weakness; thus, special_eff remains empty [].\n\n**slow_eff**: The story says, \"slowing it amplified its suffering,\" which implies that slowing the monster significantly increases its vulnerability or reduces its effectiveness. This aligns with the definition of [\"Weak\"], meaning slows have a pronounced tactical advantage.\n\n**occurrence**: The key sentence is \"only one could appear at a time,\" which directly matches the definition of [\"Single\"]—the monster never appears alongside another of its kind in a wave."
"**best_atk_spd**: The story states, \"each blow weakened it further,\" indicating that the Frostbound Elemental becomes progressively weaker as it takes damage. This suggests that rapid, successive hits will maximize damage output by compounding its weakening state, making a \"Fast\" attack speed ideal to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**weak**: The passage explicitly notes that \"blunt strikes wounded it deeply,\" and a hunter confirms \"grab a club—blunt force does the trick where magic fails.\" This direct evidence shows that Blunt attacks are particularly effective, justifying [\"Blunt\"] in the weak list.\n\n**resist**: The text clearly states that \"poison barely touched it, and ice or lightning did little harm,\" which directly indicates resistance to Poison, Ice, and Lightning. These elements are therefore correctly listed in resist, as they have minimal effect on the monster.\n\n**special_eff**: Although Blunt is noted as highly effective, there is no indication that it provides a unique bonus beyond normal damage (e.g., no mention of breaking shields, stacking effects, or exclusive disruption). Since no element is described as having a *distinctive* mechanical advantage beyond standard weakness, special_eff remains empty, consistent with the ground truth.\n\n**slow_eff**: The story reveals that \"slowing it amplified its suffering,\" meaning the Frostbound Elemental is not merely slowed but significantly impaired when subjected to slowing effects. This heightened vulnerability qualifies it for [\"Weak\"], as its threat level diminishes disproportionately under such conditions.\n\n**occurrence**: The narrative specifies that \"only one could appear at a time,\" which directly matches the definition of [\"Single\"]—the monster always appears alone in a wave, never accompanied by others of its kind."
